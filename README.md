# 2D-Grid-Game Maze like game
It's a simple 2D grid game where you move through a maze to get the treasure at the end.

## The mission

- Build a maze from a 2D Array.
- Using the keyboard you can navigate in the maze (you can only stay on paths, you cannot cross walls)
- Get to the end before the end time and progress to the nex level.
- levels 1-3 are predifined but randomly generated after.
- levels get progressively more difficult with added ennemies and shooting mechanics? Coins and collectibles to collect as well as upgrades
- beautifull graphics


The first level looks like this (starting as a red tile, treasure as a yellow tile)
